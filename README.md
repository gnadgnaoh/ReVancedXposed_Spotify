### The Impact of Server-Side Consistency Checks

Starting from late January 2026, the server has implemented a new verification logic 
that enforces strict **dual-sync checks** for account attributes and configuration data. 
The server now cross-references your account attributes (such as Subscription Type) and 
core configuration data in real-time. If client-side modifications or suppressed logics are detected, 
the server will immediately forcibly terminate the session.

**To prevent frequent logouts, we have adjusted the patches to prioritize usability. **

**Consequently:**

- Audio and visual ads will now appear.
- Non-functional Download button now visible.

Remember: if you are not paying for the product, **you** are the product.

### Regarding alleged “new working Spotify mods”:

Recent claims that _Nibrut, Obito, AndroForever and Shizuku_ provide functioning Spotify mods are incorrect.  
Their mod merely applies _Rootless Xposed Framework_ and _generic signature bypass patcher_ together with this module,  
e.g. Mochi Cloner, App Cloner, LSPatch, NPatch, HKP, MT Manager, NP Manager.  
However, it **does not** address or bypass the actual mechanisms responsible for detecting and blocking modified clients.    
ReVanced Xposed has nothing to do with the bypass mechanisms.  
  
These mods work for a few days until a Spotify app update is released, then Spotify blacklists users of these modded apps on old versions of the client from the server.  
  
Before ReVanced paused patches for Spotify for legal reason,  
they released a working test version that still works to this day.  
There is something you need to know in order to use it, so find it on the xManager Discord Server and read the instructions.
